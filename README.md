# Gardener for citizenlab/test-lists

This repository contains an experimental tool for keeping the test-lists
up-to-date. This initial implementation focuses on:

1. classifying test-list entries to list the reason for redirect.

This code is EXPERIMENTAL. Use with care. We will further expand this
README document if this code ever becomes useful.

We merged a gardener in [ooni/probe-cli](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/)
with [ooni/probe-cli#1114](https://github.com/ooni/probe-cli/pull/1114). We are
now going to archive this repository, which will still serve as a future
reference for implementing HTTPS checks.
