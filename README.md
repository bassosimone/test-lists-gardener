# Gardener for citizenlab/test-lists

This repository contains an experimental tool for keeping the test-lists
up-to-date. This initial implementation focuses on:

1. classifying test-list entries to list the reason for redirect.

This code is EXPERIMENTAL. Use with care. We will further expand this
README document if this code ever becomes useful.
